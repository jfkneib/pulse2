This directory contains every material needed to create the database
required by the IMAGING module to store its informations.

As the IMAGING evolve, so does the IMAGING database. This directory contains the
base schema (schema.sql) and subsequents evolutions (schema.sql.v.x).

To obtain a state-of-the-art MSC database, here is how to proceed:

1) create a new database called "imaging":
    mysqladmin create imaging

2) inject the base schema:
    mysql msc < schema.sql

3) inject evolutions: (when there will be...)
    mysql msc < schema.sql.v.2
    mysql msc < schema.sql.v.3
    ...

4) create a new user with relevant privileges:
    mysql imaging <<EOF
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON imaging.* TO 'mmc'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'mmc' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES
EOF

5) update your /etc/mmc/plugins/imaging.ini

6) enjoy !
